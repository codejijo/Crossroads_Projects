# Python GUI Calculator

This is a **Simple GUI Scientific Calculator** based on python's inbuilt GUI module Tkinter. I did this work inspired by the Python coding challenge hosted by [Crossroads](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoGHeFY7jE2OB_TJS_87MOA "Best Programming Based Malayalam Tutorial Channel") youtube channel. Other than normal calculator functions, I have added many features and some are in beta stage.

## Key Features

* Scientific Mode with **Inverse** Function
* Themes
* History with Use History feature
